# LASSO regression

This folder contains the code for the analysis using LASSO models.

In LASSO_model.R the models are run for recurrence, progression and relapse. The results for each SNP are saved.

In Plot_by_chromosome.R the bar plot representing the proportion of SNPs selected by chromosome is created.
